//! What the console shows: one buffer of classified lines, and the queue the logger feeds it
//! through.
//!
//! Command output and log records end up in the same scrollback on purpose — a console that
//! only echoes what was typed cannot answer "what did the loader just do", which is the
//! question people actually open it for. They arrive by different routes, though: command
//! output is printed into the buffer under the state lock, while a log record can be emitted
//! from any thread at any depth, including from inside a state method. So the logger only
//! appends to [`record`]'s queue, which is a leaf lock and takes no other, and the buffer
//! drains that queue at the moments it is already holding the state.
//!
//! Nothing in this module logs. The sink would call straight back into itself.
