//! Inline function detours: the jump written at a function's entry, and the trampoline that
//! still reaches the original.
//!
//! The shape is the usual one. The target's first instructions are decoded until at least a
//! five byte `jmp rel32` fits, copied into a trampoline that ends in an absolute jump back to
//! the rest of the function, and the entry is replaced with a jump to the plugin. Because a
//! plugin DLL can sit further than two gigabytes from the game's code, the five byte jump goes
//! to a relay allocated *near the target*, and the relay performs the 14 byte absolute jump.
//!
//! What is deliberately refused rather than guessed:
//!
//! - an instruction in the stolen bytes that is relative to the instruction pointer, which
//!   would mean something different once it lives in the trampoline;
//! - a branch, call or return in the stolen bytes, for the same reason;
//! - a prologue that does not reach five bytes within a handful of instructions.
//!
//! What this does not do is suspend the game's other threads while the jump is written. A
//! thread executing exactly those bytes in that instant is a real if small risk, so hooks
//! belong in `start` or `on_swapchain`, not in the middle of a frame.

// FFI module: allocates executable memory and rewrites the game's code.
