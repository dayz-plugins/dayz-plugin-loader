//! Small buttons whose icon is drawn, not spelled.
//!
//! The overlay used to put `✕` on the close button and `⟲` on the revert button. Both of
//! those are outside the Latin range that `Ubuntu-Light` covers, and in the game they came
//! out as the missing-glyph box — so every window was closed by a button that looked broken.
//!
//! Drawing the icon instead of asking the font for it removes the question. It also stays
//! sharp at any scale, which a bitmap-size glyph fallback would not, and it keeps the loader
//! from shipping a font file of its own just to say "close".
