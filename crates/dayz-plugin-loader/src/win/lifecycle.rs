//! The `plugin load|stop|enable|disable` console operations.
//!
//! These are the lifecycle changes that are actually sound in-process:
//!
//! - **load** appends a plugin the loader did not start at launch, after the same dependency
//!   checks `load_all` applies, and pulls in whatever that plugin depends on first. A plugin
//!   built while the game runs can be tried without restarting it, as long as the DLL has a
//!   file name nothing loaded before.
//! - **stop** calls the plugin's stop export with [`StopReason::Unload`], tears down the hooks
//!   it registered and stops delivering callbacks. The DLL stays in the process:
//!   `FreeLibrary` would pull the ground out from under the threads it started and every
//!   pointer the loader and other plugins hold.
//! - **enable** and **disable** pause and resume delivery, telling the plugin through
//!   `on_enable` and `on_disable`, which is the cheap way to take a misbehaving plugin out of
//!   the frame path without losing its state.
//!
//! Nothing here runs under the state lock while a plugin is being called, so a plugin may
//! issue these from its own command handler.
