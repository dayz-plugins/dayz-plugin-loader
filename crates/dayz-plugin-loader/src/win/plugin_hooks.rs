//! Hooks a plugin registers through the loader, so the loader can undo them.
//!
//! A plugin that patches the game itself owns a change nobody else knows about: when it
//! stops, or faults, or is simply buggy, the patch stays and the next thing to touch that
//! address finds something it did not write. Registering the hook here instead means the
//! loader holds the original bytes, the original vtable pointer or the detour object, and
//! removes them in reverse order when the plugin goes away.
//!
//! Three kinds, because they are what hooking this game actually needs:
//!
//! - **patch**: bytes at an address, for example turning a call into `nop`s.
//! - **vtable**: one slot of a virtual table, which is how the loader hooks DXGI itself.
//! - **detour**: an inline jump at a function's entry, with a trampoline that reaches the
//!   original; see [`super::detour`] for how the prologue is relocated.
//!
//! What this cannot do is make a bad patch safe. The loader checks that an address is
//! committed memory and that nothing else has hooked it, and nothing more: a plugin that
//! patches the wrong instruction still breaks the game, it just does not break the *next*
//! session too.

// FFI module: writes to the game's own memory on a plugin's behalf.
